# GIV-Mathematics
This is a project repo for the Governor's Institute Mathematics Group in 2024

## Our Goal
By the end of class you will be writing code in Python, a common programming language.


## Agenda
- Everyone signed up for [GitHub.com](https://github.com/) (or log in if you have not before)
- Go to this repo and go into Codespaces
- install python and jupyter
- Jupyter Basics
- Coding Basics
- Break into groups of 3-4 people and tackle a Challenges (remeber work through the logic on paper, then code)

## Usage

This uses [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) as a way to explore Python. As we cannot set up coding environments on the lab computers we will instead try running this with in Github Codespace (an online coding environment):

1. Sign In to GitHub: Ensure you are signed in to your GitHub account. If you don't have an account, create one at github.com.
2. Navigate to the Repository: Go to the GitHub repository for which you want to create a Codespace. This can be a repository you own or have access to.
3. Open the Codespaces Tab: On the repository page, click on the <> Code button located above the list of files in the repository.
4. Create a Codespace: In the dropdown menu, click on the Codespaces tab. Click the New codespace button.
5. Launch the Codespace: After configuration, click on the Create codespace button. GitHub will begin setting up the Codespace. This may take a few minutes.
6. Access the Codespace: Once the Codespace is created, it will open in a new tab in your browser. You will see a web-based Visual Studio Code (VS Code) interface with your repositoryâ€™s files loaded.
7. Start Coding: You can now start coding in the Codespace. The environment will have access to all the features of VS Code, including extensions, terminal, version control, and more.
8. Stopping and Reconnecting: When you are done, you can stop the Codespace by closing the tab. Your Codespace will be saved, and you can reconnect to it later from the Codespaces tab in your repository.

If this does not work we can use [https://jupyter.org/try-jupyter/lab/](https://jupyter.org/try-jupyter/lab/) (or if that doesn't work [https://jupyter.org/try](https://jupyter.org/try)) and copy and paste code in a new notebook in that environment
